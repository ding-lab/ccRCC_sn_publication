This github repository contains the data files and analysis code used in "Epigenetic and transcriptomic characterization reveals progression markers and essential pathways in clear cell renal cell carcinoma"

The files are organised into three folders:

data: which contains all the genomic and transcriptomic data required to perform the analyses described in the paper
R: contains the R code to reproduce all analyses
resources: contains additional databases (eg gene lists) which are required by the R scripts.
